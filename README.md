# Now, let's delve into a fascinating project I worked on as part of the certification:
## Project Overview
The project aimed to address a crucial question related to SpaceX rocket launches. SpaceX offers Falcon 9 rocket launches at a significantly lower cost compared to other providers. One of the key factors contributing to this cost reduction is SpaceX's ability to reuse the first stage of the rocket. The objective of the project was to predict the success of the first-stage landing of the Falcon 9 rocket. This information could be valuable for companies interested in competing with SpaceX for rocket launch contracts
## Problem Statement
Identify the factors that influence the success of landing the Falcon 9 rocket's first stage.
Examine the relationships between variables that impact the success rate of the first-stage landing.
